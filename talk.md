- copy-paste from SO
- copyright vs. patent
- default license
- who owns the code?
- practical aspects
- recommendations
- permissive vs. non-permissive
- standard vs. non-standard
- share-alike

## Goals

- Motivate why software licenses matter
- Provide guidance on which license to choose

---

## IANAL disclaimer

---

## Patents vs. copyright

- Patents protect ideas
- Copyright protects the **expression** of an idea
- Copyright is automatically attached to every novel expression of an idea (for a certain amount of years)
- Software that you write is copyrighted by default
- No person other than the creator has the right under copyright law to create "derivative works"

---

## Who owns the copyright for software you write?

- You?
- Your university?

### It depends on the country!

### If you do not own your software, you can:

- Request a transfer of ownership (check with your university)
- Open source your code to make sure you are not locked out of your own code
  once you change affiliation (you might need to inform your university)

## These slides are an expression of an idea

## Creative commons licenses

## Public domain

- Software in the public domain has no owner
- Open source does not mean public domain
- Open source software remains the intellectual property of the copyright owner

## When to worry about software licenses

## Academic licenses vs. reciprocal licenses

- Copyleft synonymous for reciprocity

---

## Reciprocity: Share and Share Alike?

## Derivative works

How can you tell when you have created a derivative work?

- Modifying source code by revising the code or translating it into another computer language is derivative work

The primary indication of whether a new program is a derivative work is whether the source code of the original program was used, modified, translated or otherwise changed in any way to create the new program.

Typically not derivative works:

- Linking to libraries, plug-ins, and drivers

## Clean room design

1. Team A studies code A
2. Team A writes specifications for code A
3. Legal team checks specifications
4. Team B never sees code A
5. Team B implements code B based on specifications

---

## Licenses and restrictions

- A license must contain limitations
- Licenses may limit modifications of the code
- Open source licenses may limit modifications of the license
